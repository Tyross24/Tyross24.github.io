<h2>Job Description</h2>
<p>A versatile job role that handles the programming that directly links to the player/game experience. It is different from specialist hires such as an engine programmer, who works on the system the game runs on. The gameplay programmer is there to construct the game using assets provided from designers and other programmers. This construction of the game involves a huge amount of decision and responsibility of how the player reacts in the game world and the multiple ways objects can be interacted with.</p>
<h2>Project Role</h2>
<p>The gameplay programmer role can vary between different companies and studios but there are a variety of similarities between the role. Foremost gameplay programmers spend time on only one game at a time, their job is associated with a specific game as their focus is on constructing one IP (intellectual property) so the assets and scripts that they will be using and producing will be specific to that game they have been assigned. The versatility of the job, therefore, comes from the different aspects that they are touching upon throughout the development, whether they are introducing audio into the game or implementing the user interface for the player to see. Instead of focusing on specific systems that can be integrated between IP&rsquo;s, the gameplay programmer will be implementing interactions and choices, for example, health loss/regeneration, movement/exploring controls and combat mechanics that fit with the specific the game.</p>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Working within a team is a key skill for any aspect of game development jobs. In this scenario as a gameplay programmer, the main communication is between the artists and designers, these people have produced assets for the game such as audio files and 3d models for the world. The design team that includes the level design and story writers will be key to providing the best possible game experience and implementing it successfully. This means that the gameplay programmer must have meetings and discussion with them frequently to ensure that firstly, they have the correct assets to implement into the game to populate the level, but secondly to ensure that they too are making the appropriate decisions, and ensuring a correctly driven story, maintaining the desired &lsquo;feel&rsquo; in the game through interface interaction and movement styles.</p>
<h2>Education and Training</h2>
<p>The education necessary for becoming a gameplay programmer can depend on the company and standard held by them, for example, a studio that has more titles and experience will look for an individual who can display a higher skill level. Indie developers and unseasoned smaller studios will require less from their applicants as they have less reputation to uphold. However, there is a common theme throughout the industry and from looking at a few different job advertisements, this is the need for a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. The degree-level, however, is what is assessed by the company. Creative Assembly hiring for a gameplay programmer for their Total War series looks for &lsquo;excellent academic background with a 2:1 degree or higher&rsquo;. The BSc must be in a relevant field, such as computer science or a game development course, and have relevant coding experience.</p>
<h2>Skillset</h2>
<p>Again, the skill set can vary depending on the studio and job skill level. Furthermore, the job skill set is will grow, or be more advanced corresponding to the level of salary the applicant will earn. In this case, the skill set required can grow but the best way to summarise the skill set is to correlate it to the job. As a programming role the applicant will need to have good knowledge of the language being used to create the game, this could be C++, C# or other relevant languages. A gameplay programmer needs to be able to communicate, as their job will require them to interact with various members of the studio team. Knowledge of programming best practices and object-orientated skills. If the game is an RPG then a good knowledge of other RPG titles and role-playing mechanics will be necessary. Indie developers are less likely to have their game engine, so a good knowledge of relevant engines, like unity or unreal will be advertised skills.</p>
<h2>Salary</h2>
<p>As an individual&rsquo;s skill level and experience within the industry grows so does the salary that goes along with the job. Of course, as these increases so do the level of responsibility within the position. This means that a newly graduated programmer would enter into a junior position, to begin the salary for such a position may be around &pound;20,000 a year, with the responsibility of a junior gameplay programmer being more of an assistant, or a lesser role where your tasks aren&rsquo;t as critical to the overall gameplay. As the individual gains experience, they will be promoted with more critical roles, and have more involvement with the decisions within the gameplay that will directly affect the players experience, for these more senior roles the applicant could be looking at a raised salary of around &pound;30,000 to &pound;50,000 depending on exactly the responsibilities and skill level necessary for the position, along with the skills, the companies popularity and experience effects this as a larger studio with many releases will have more money to spend on staff than a small indie studio. Salaries can exceed this amount, and again the correlation continues. With more responsibility, the position as a head gameplay programmer can become more of a project leader position, the role will be more than just implementing ideas and now creating core features and mechanics for the game, having huge responsibility for the title and the path that it will follow through production. Extra team management skills will be required, having to the overseer and manage those who have filled junior roles as well as requesting audio and assets instead of using what has been given to you. These roles can have salaries that begin at &pound;50,000 and can reach upwards of &pound;75,000.</p>

<p>Most games developers run out of the office like buildings, desks assorted with PC&rsquo;s and teams in talking range of each member, different areas are assigned to different teams whether it is designers or programmers.
